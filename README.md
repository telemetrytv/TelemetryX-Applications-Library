# TelemetryX Applications Library

A collection of production-ready applications for the TelemetryX digital signage platform.

## Overview

### What is TelemetryX?

TelemetryX is a revolutionary low-code platform that transforms commercial digital displays into intelligent, interactive application platforms. Unlike traditional digital signage solutions that require complex content management systems and limited functionality, TelemetryX enables developers to build and deploy full-fledged applications using familiar web technologies like React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript.

### Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a centralized library of production-ready applications specifically designed for the TelemetryX ecosystem. Each application here is:

- **Completely Independent**: Every app is a standalone project with its own dependencies, build system, and configuration
- **Production-Ready**: Built for 24/7 operation on commercial displays in retail, corporate, healthcare, and public spaces
- **SDK-Integrated**: Leverages the `@telemetryx/sdk` for seamless integration with device capabilities, data sources, and platform features
- **Display-Optimized**: Designed for viewing distances of 6-10 feet with high contrast, large text, and clear visual hierarchies
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Includes comprehensive error handling, offline fallbacks, and memory management for continuous operation

### Key Features

- **Rapid Development**: Use `tx init` to scaffold a new application in seconds with all the boilerplate configured
- **Built-in Development Harness**: Each app includes a development server with dual-view testing (render + settings)
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Access weather, calendar, RSS feeds, social media, and custom data sources through the SDK
- **Device Capabilities**: Interact with screen hardware, sensors, and local storage through a unified API
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Development server with instant updates as you code
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety with TypeScript 5.7+ and strict mode enabled

### Target Environments

Applications in this library are designed to run on:

- **Digital Signage Displays**: Commercial screens in retail stores, lobbies, waiting rooms
- **Interactive Kiosks**: Touch-enabled displays for wayfinding, information, and engagement
- **Video Walls**: Multi-screen installations in corporate offices and public spaces
- **Meeting Room Displays**: Conference room schedulers and information boards
- **Menu Boards**: Dynamic pricing and content for restaurants and cafes

### Why TelemetryX?

- **Familiar Stack**: Build with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies you already know
- **No Proprietary Tools**: Use your favorite IDE, version control, and development workflow
- **Platform Agnostic**: Applications work across different display hardware and operating systems
- **Scalable**: Deploy one app or thousands, manage from a single dashboard
- **Real-time Updates**: Push updates instantly to all displays without downtime

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 21+ and pnpm (or npm)
- TelemetryX CLI for development and testing

### Install TelemetryX CLI

```bash
# Install globally with pnpm
pnpm add -g @telemetryx/cli

# Or with npm
npm install -g @telemetryx/cli
```

### Create a New Application

```bash
# Generate a new TelemetryX application
tx init

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Choose application name
# - Select template (creates a barebones hello world)
# - Configure mount points
# The CLI will create a complete application structure
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd TelemetryX-Applications-Library

# Navigate to an application
cd applications/[app-name]

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev  # Runs 'tx serve'
# The TelemetryX harness opens automatically at http://localhost:6969
# Your app runs on http://localhost:3000 (configured in telemetry.config.json)

# Build for production (if build scripts are configured)
pnpm run build
```

## Available Applications

Each application in the `applications/` directory is production-ready and includes:

- Full TypeScript support with strict mode
- React 19.1+ with modern hooks
- TelemetryX SDK integration
- Error boundaries for 24/7 operation
- Offline fallback capabilities
- Optimized for distance viewing

## Creating New Applications

### Using TelemetryX CLI (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a new application:

```bash
# From the applications directory
cd applications/
tx init

# The CLI will:
# - Create a barebones hello world application
# - Set up mount points
# - Install dependencies
# - Configure the development harness

# Then run the app:
cd [your-app-name]
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:6969 in your browser
```

### Manual Creation

If creating manually, each application must include:

```
applications/your-app/
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx              # Main app with router
│   ├── main.tsx             # App entry point
│   └── views/
│       ├── Render.tsx       # Render view component
│       └── Settings.tsx     # Settings view component
├── assets/                  # Static assets
├── index.html              # HTML entry point
├── package.json            # Dependencies
├── tsconfig.json           # TypeScript config
├── vite.config.ts          # Vite configuration
├── telemetry.config.json   # TelemetryX configuration
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml     # PNPM workspace config
```

### Package Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "your-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A telemetryX application",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tx serve"
  },

}
```

### TelemetryX Configuration

Create a `telemetry.config.json` file:

```json
{

  }
}
```

## Testing Applications

### Development Server

Each application includes a built-in development harness:

```bash
# From your application directory
cd applications/[app-name]

# Start the development server
pnpm dev  # Runs 'tx serve'

# The TelemetryX harness opens at:
# http://localhost:6969
```

### Development Features

The `pnpm dev` command provides:
- **Built-in Harness**: Complete TelemetryX development environment
- **Dual View**: See both render and settings interfaces
- **SDK Mocking**: Complete TelemetryX SDK simulation
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic refresh on file changes
- **Device Simulation**: Test different screen sizes and capabilities
- **Mock Data**: Weather, calendar, RSS, and social media data
