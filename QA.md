# TelemetryX Applications Library - QA Summary

## Project Overview for QA

The **TelemetryX Applications Library** is a collection of standalone web applications designed for 24/7 operation on digital signage displays. Each application runs independently on the TelemetryX platform, which transforms screens into interactive application platforms.

### Critical QA Context
- **Runtime Environment**: Applications run continuously on public displays (TVs, kiosks, touchscreens)
- **Isolation**: Each app runs in an iframe for security and stability
- **Independence**: Applications cannot affect each other - complete isolation
- **Platform Integration**: All apps communicate with TelemetryX platform via SDK

## Testing Scope

### Application Inventory

| Application | Path | Status | Priority | Key Test Areas |
|------------|------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Weather | `/applications/weather` | Production | High | API failures, offline mode, location detection, UI themes |
| YouTube | `/applications/youtube` | Production | High | Video playback, playlist management, network interruptions |
| RSS Feed | `/applications/rss` | Production | Medium | Feed parsing, content updates, malformed data handling |
| Slack | `/applications/slack` | Production | Medium | Authentication, message updates, privacy settings |
| Clock | `/applications/clock` | Production | Low | Timezone accuracy, DST transitions, performance |
| Notice | `/applications/notice` | Production | Low | Text rendering, multi-language support |
| Hello World | `/applications/hello-world` | Example | Low | Component library integration, settings persistence |

## Test Environment Setup

2. Performance tab > Record for 60 seconds
3. Look for steadily increasing memory line

// Common causes:
- Uncleared intervals/timeouts
- Event listeners not removed
- Large objects in closures
- Detached DOM references
```

### Issue: Network Request Failures
```javascript
// Testing approach:
1. Chrome DevTools > Network tab
2. Set throttling to "Offline"
3. Verify app shows cached/fallback content
4. Re-enable network
5. Verify app recovers and updates
```

### Issue: Display Scaling Problems
```javascript
// Testing approach:
1. Use device emulation in Chrome
2. Test multiple resolutions
3. Verify responsive design breakpoints
4. Check text remains readable
5. Ensure no UI elements overlap
```

## Automation Testing

### TypeScript Validation
```bash
# Run from application directory
npm run typecheck

# Expected: No TypeScript errors
# Watch for:
- Any use of 'any' type
- Unchecked array access
- Missing null checks
```

### Build Verification
```bash
# Build all applications
npm run build:all

# Verify each app:
- Creates dist/ folder
- No build errors
- Bundle size reasonable (< 500KB per app)
```

### Linting and Code Quality
```bash
# If configured in application
npm run lint

# Check for:

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Device Types and Testing

#### Digital Signage Displays
```yaml
Samsung Smart Signage:
  - Resolution: 1920x1080, 3840x2160
  - Browser: Tizen browser (Chromium-based)
  - Memory: 2-4GB RAM
  - Special considerations:
    - Limited GPU acceleration
    - Auto-power management
    - Remote management capability

LG WebOS Displays:
  - Resolution: 1920x1080, 3840x2160
  - Browser: WebOS browser
  - Memory: 2-3GB RAM
  - Special considerations:
    - WebOS-specific APIs
    - Screen burn-in prevention
    - Scheduled on/off times

Chrome OS Devices:
  - Resolution: Various
  - Browser: Chrome (latest)
  - Memory: 4-8GB RAM
  - Special considerations:
    - Full Chrome DevTools access
    - Easy remote debugging
    - Automatic updates

Windows/Linux Media Players:
  - Resolution: Configurable
  - Browser: Chrome/Edge in kiosk mode
  - Memory: 4-16GB RAM
  - Special considerations:
    - Full OS access
    - Custom scripts possible
    - Hardware acceleration varies
```

#### Testing Matrix
```bash
# Device-specific test scenarios

```

### Network Environments

#### Bandwidth Considerations
```yaml
Minimum Requirements:
  - Initial load: 2 Mbps
  - Streaming content: 5 Mbps
  - Updates: 1 Mbps

Network Conditions to Test:
  - High latency (satellite): 500ms+
  - Packet loss: 1-5%
  - Bandwidth throttling: 1 Mbps
  - Intermittent connectivity
  - Proxy/firewall restrictions
```

#### Offline Capabilities
```javascript
// Service Worker for offline support
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
      .catch(() => caches.match('/offline.html'))
  );
});

// Cache strategy
- Static assets: Cache first
- API data: Network first, fallback to cache
- Media files: Lazy cache on demand
```

## Scalability and Load Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios
```bash
# Using k6 for load testing
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 },  // Ramp up
    { duration: '10m', target: 100 }, // Stay at 100
    { duration: '5m', target: 1000 }, // Spike test
    { duration: '10m', target: 500 }, // Normal load
    { duration: '5m', target: 0 },    // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% under 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],    // Error rate under 10%
  },
};

export default function() {
  let response = http.get('https://api.telemetryx.ai/apps/weather');
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
}
```

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Usage Monitoring
```yaml
Cost Centers:
  - CDN bandwidth: $0.085/GB
  - API requests: $0.001/1000 requests
  - Storage: $0.023/GB/month
  - Compute: $0.05/hour

Optimization Strategies:
  - Enable CDN compression (30-70% bandwidth reduction)
  - Implement request caching (50% API reduction)
  - Archive old data to cold storage
  - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads
  - Implement auto-scaling policies

Monthly Budget Alerts:
  - 50% threshold: Information
  - 75% threshold: Warning
  - 90% threshold: Critical
  - 100% threshold: Automatic scaling limits
```
