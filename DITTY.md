# The TelemetryX Ditty ðŸŽµ

*To the tune of "Modern Major-General" (or any jaunty rhythm you prefer)*

---

**Oh, TelemetryX is here to save the day!**  
From static screens to apps that play,  
With React and JS, no need to pray,  
Your displays are smart in every way!

**Chorus:**  
*Push to Git, deploy with ease,*  
*From one screen to a thousand, please!*  
*IoT sensors, data flows,*  
*TelemetryX, the platform that knows!*

**Not just a playlist, not just a loop,**  
But full-stack apps for every group,  
From retail floors to factory lines,  
Your screens now run on cloud designs!

**Node Pro hardware, built to last,**  
With MQTT and ports so fast,  
Connect your cameras, buttons too,  
There's nothing that this can't breakthrough!

**Chorus:**  
*Push to Git, deploy with ease,*  
*From one screen to a thousand, please!*  
*IoT sensors, data flows,*  
*TelemetryX, the platform that knows!*

**With AI helpers by your side,**  
Low-code magic, far and wide,  
From TelemetryTV's proven base,  
Enterprise-grade in every space!

**So here's to screens that think and do,**  
To dashboards fresh and kiosks new,  
TelemetryX has set them freeâ€”  
The future of displays, you'll see!

**Final Chorus:**  
*Build it once, then scale it wide,*  
*Web-native tech with hardware tied,*  
*From simple signs to apps that wow,*  
*TelemetryX delivers now!*
